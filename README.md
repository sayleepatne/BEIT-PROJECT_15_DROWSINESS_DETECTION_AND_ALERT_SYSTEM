In the developed system, a front camera of driverâ€™s cell phone records the video and driver's face is detected. For this purpose, eyes, nose and mouth are detected to improve the area of interest using Google vision API. It is the best choice when it comes to face detection for better performance of Real Time Image processing. B4A is used as it is an simple and powerful tool for developing the Android applications. When the drowsiness is detected, then the driver is alerted by audio. In this, the user is able to login into the app. If the user visits for the first time then he/she has to register. After that he/she can login into the app and start the process. It has a feature, if the user forgets its password then an OTP will be sent to the registered mobile number and then the user is able to reset the password. When the process starts, frames are captured every 5 seconds and then probabilty is calculated. If the probability is less than 50% then drowsiness is detected and alert is send.
